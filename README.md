# VR-Galerie Monnin, Virtual Photos Exhibition from M. Roberto STEPHENSON, Port au Prince, Juillet 2019

Created for the Galerie Monnin, following the Haiti Tech Summit, in July 2019.

The idea is to allow the user to immerse himself/herself inside a virtual gallery showcasing the work of renown Haitian photographer called Roberto STEPHENSON.

In VR, using a Samsung Gear VR and its controller, the user can:
- Apply the trigger to teleport from its current location to a distant location (aiming with a red/green laser beam)
- "Caress" the touchpad to move from its current location to a nearby location.

Inside the gallery, the user can see 
- Videos applied as textures on virtual movie screens
- Avatars integrated into the virtual gallery.

This VR application was designed using Unity 2018.2.11f1.

It was built for the folowing platforms:
- Desktop (Windows 10)
- WebGL (visible at: https://patrickattie.itch.io/galerievirtuelle, password = galvir)
- Samsung Gear and controller (using touchpad and trigger).
